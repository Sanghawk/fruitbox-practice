## **May 16th, 2025**

## **May 15th, 2025**

### Summary:

Introducing the new point system! A lot of feedback received was based around creating combinations over 2 cell pairs more rewarding. I hope this new point system reflects this.

### How it works:

`C` = cell count of the selection. For example:\
[5,5] = 2 cells\
[7,2,1] = 3 cells\
[1,1,4,4] = 4 cells

`M_length` = length multiplier. Anything above 2 cell selection benefit from the length multiplier.

`M_length` is calculated:

`M_length` = 1 + (`M_length_weight` \* (`C` - 2))

- Where `C` > 2 and `M_length_weight` is set at _0.1_

`M_shape` = shape multiplier. The selection "shape" can be 1 of 2 things `line` or `rect`. Only selection that are `rect` in shape benefit from this multiplier.

`line` = 1 dimensional selection (1x2, 1x4, etc.)\
`rect` = 2 dimensional selection (2x2, 3x2, etc.)\
`I_rect` = 1 if `rect`, 0 if `line`

`M_shape` is calculated:

`M_shape` = 1 + (`M_shape_weight` \* `I_rect`)

- where `M_shape_weight` is set at _0.2_

All together, points are calculated with:

points = `C` \* `M_length` \* `M_shape`

### _General changes_

There's only 3 Tenzy pages (`/tenzy`, `/tenzy/leaderboard`, `/tenzy/changelog`), but it got confusing how I get from submitting my score to actually viewing it on the leaderboard.
