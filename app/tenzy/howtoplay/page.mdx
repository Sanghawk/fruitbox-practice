# How to Play Tenzy:

Tenzy is a fast-paced number game where you select groups of numbers on an 8x8 grid that add up **exactly to 10**. You have **90 seconds** to clear as many cells as possible!

<GameGridDummy />

### Selection Rules:

- You must select at least **2 adjacent cells**.
- Selections can only form:

  - **Straight lines** (horizontal or vertical).
  - **Rectangles** (solid shapes, no gaps).

- You **cannot** make irregular shapes, such as "L" or diagonal selections.

### Scoring System:

Points depend on the **number of cells** selected (**C**) and the **shape** of your selection:

- **More cells = more points:**
  Larger selections give bonus points. For every additional cell beyond 2, your points increase.

- **Rectangle bonus:**
  Rectangle-shaped selections receive additional bonus points compared to straight-line selections.

#### Points Formula:

```
points = C × M_length × M_shape
```

- **C**: Number of cells selected.
- **M_length**: Multiplier for length.

  ```
  M_length = 1 + (0.1 × (C - 2)) for selections larger than 2 cells.
  ```

- **M_shape**: Multiplier for shape.

  ```
  M_shape = 1.2 for rectangles, 1.0 for lines.
  ```

### Example Calculations:

**Example 1: 2-cell straight line**

<GameGridDummy example={"1"} />

- **C** = 2
- **M_length** = 1.0 (no bonus for 2 cells)
- **M_shape** = 1.0 (line shape)

**Points** = `2 × 1.0 × 1.0` = **2 points**

---

**Example 2: 3-cell straight line**

<GameGridDummy example={"2"} />

- **C** = 3
- **M_length** = `1 + (0.1 × (3 - 2))` = **1.1**
- **M_shape** = 1.0 (line shape)

**Points** = `3 × 1.1 × 1.0` = **3.3 points**

---

**Example 3: 4-cell rectangle**

(rectangle shape)

<GameGridDummy example={"3"} />

- **C** = 4
- **M_length** = `1 + (0.1 × (4 - 2))` = **1.2**
- **M_shape** = 1.2 (rectangle bonus)

**Points** = `4 × 1.2 × 1.2` = **5.76 points**

---

**Example 4: 5-cell straight line**

<GameGridDummy example={"4"} />

- **C** = 5
- **M_length** = `1 + (0.1 × (5 - 2))` = **1.3**
- **M_shape** = 1.0 (line shape)

**Points** = `5 × 1.3 × 1.0` = **6.5 points**

---

**Example 5: 6-cell rectangle**

(rectangle shape)

<GameGridDummy example={"5"} />

- **C** = 6
- **M_length** = `1 + (0.1 × (6 - 2))` = **1.4**
- **M_shape** = 1.2 (rectangle bonus)

**Points** = `6 × 1.4 × 1.2` = **10.08 points**

---

These examples demonstrate how strategic selections—larger groups and rectangle shapes—significantly boost your score.

Select smart, select fast, and aim for high scores!
